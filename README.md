# Twitch Channel Points Miner v2

A Python bot that watches Twitch streams on your behalf and earns [channel points](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide): watch time, claim bonuses, follow raids, place predictions, claim drops, and more.

This repository is a fork of [rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2), which continues development from [Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2).

## Features

- **Passive earning**: watch time, stream-start bonuses (+450), claim buttons (+50), raid follows (+250), watch streaks
- **Predictions**: configurable bet strategies, filters, delays, and stealth mode
- **Drops & moments**: progress toward drop campaigns and claim [Moments](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/moments) when available
- **Smart prioritization**: watch streaks, drops, subscription tier, channel point balance, or your streamer list order
- **Follower list mining**: optionally load your followed channels automatically
- **IRC chat presence**: join chat to improve watch-time tracking and detect `@mentions`
- **Analytics dashboard**: optional Flask chart of point gains over time
- **Notifications**: Telegram, Discord, generic webhooks, Matrix, Pushover, and Gotify
- **Structured logging**: colored console output, log files, session summaries, and emoji support (disable on Windows if needed)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (3.10 used in Docker; 3.12 works locally)
- A Twitch account

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/combwizard/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2.git
cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp example.py run.py        # edit run.py with your username and streamers
python run.py
```

On first run you will be prompted to log in unless a cookie file already exists in `cookies/`.

### Minimal configuration

```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner

miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"])
```

For the full set of options (priorities, per-streamer settings, bet strategies, and notifications), see [`example.py`](example.py).

## How it works

The miner connects to Twitch over GraphQL, PubSub WebSockets, and IRC. It tracks which streamers are live, watches up to **two channels at a time** (a Twitch limit), and performs configured actions for each active stream.

Streamer priority is controlled by the `priority` setting and the order of your streamer list. When using `followers=True`, channels can be sorted by follow date (`FollowersOrder.ASC` or `DESC`). Use `blacklist=[...]` to exclude specific channels from a follower-based list.

## Configuration reference

Settings resolve in this order (highest wins):

1. Per-streamer settings passed to `mine()`
2. `StreamerSettings` on the `TwitchChannelPointsMiner` instance
3. Built-in defaults

### Priority values

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `STREAK` | Catch watch-streak bonuses first |
| `DROPS` | Prioritize streamers with active drop campaigns |
| `SUBSCRIBED` | Prioritize subscribed channels (higher tiers first) |
| `ORDER` | Follow the streamer list order |
| `POINTS_ASCENDING` | Lowest balance first |
| `POINTS_DESCENDING` | Highest balance first |

Combine priorities as needed. Include at least one of `ORDER`, `POINTS_ASCENDING`, or `POINTS_DESCENDING` so the miner keeps watching after streaks and drops are handled.

### StreamerSettings

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `make_predictions` | bool | `True` | Place channel-point predictions |
| `follow_raid` | bool | `True` | Follow raids for bonus points |
| `claim_drops` | bool | `True` | Count watch time toward drop campaigns |
| `claim_moments` | bool | `True` | Claim Moments when available |
| `watch_streak` | bool | `True` | Prioritize channels with an active watch streak |
| `community_goals` | bool | `False` | Contribute max points to community goals |
| `chat` | `ChatPresence` | `ONLINE` | IRC presence: `ALWAYS`, `NEVER`, `ONLINE`, `OFFLINE` |
| `bet` | `BetSettings` | - | Prediction behavior (see below) |

### BetSettings

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `Strategy` | `SMART` | Outcome selection strategy |
| `percentage` | int | `5` | Bet this % of your balance |
| `percentage_gap` | int | `20` | Gap threshold for `SMART` strategy |
| `max_points` | int | `50000` | Cap on bet size |
| `minimum_points` | int | `0` | Skip bets below this balance |
| `stealth_mode` | bool | `False` | Bet just under the current leader |
| `delay_mode` | `DelayMode` | `FROM_END` | How `delay` is interpreted |
| `delay` | float | `6` | Seconds or fraction (see below) |
| `filter_condition` | `FilterCondition` | `None` | Optional gate before placing a bet |

**Strategies:** `MOST_VOTED`, `HIGH_ODDS`, `PERCENTAGE`, `SMART_MONEY`, `SMART`, `NUMBER_1` … `NUMBER_8`

**Delay modes:**

- `FROM_START`: wait `delay` seconds after the prediction opens
- `FROM_END`: place the bet `delay` seconds before it closes
- `PERCENTAGE`: place when `delay` fraction of the timer has elapsed (e.g. `0.2` = 20%)

**FilterCondition**: gate bets with `by` (`TOTAL_USERS`, `TOTAL_POINTS`, `ODDS`, `PERCENTAGE_USERS`, `ODDS_PERCENTAGE`, `TOP_POINTS`), `where` (`GT`, `LT`, `GTE`, `LTE`), and `value`.

### LoggerSettings

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `save` | bool | `True` | Write logs to `logs/` |

## Analytics

Enable data collection with `enable_analytics=True`, then start the web UI before mining:

```python
miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username", enable_analytics=True)
miner.analytics(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000, refresh=5, days_ago=7)
miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"])
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Use `host="0.0.0.0"` to reach the dashboard from another machine on your network.

When analytics is disabled (default), memory and disk use are lower and no `analytics/*.json` files are written.

## Docker

Official images: [rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2](https://hub.docker.com/r/rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2) (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`).

Mount your config and persistent data:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  miner:
    image: rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    environment:
      - TERM=xterm-256color
    volumes:
      - ./analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics
      - ./cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies
      - ./logs:/usr/src/app/logs
      - ./run.py:/usr/src/app/run.py:ro
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

`run.py` must be mounted as a volume. Use `-it` for the first login when no cookie file exists yet. On Windows, use absolute paths instead of `$(pwd)`.

For Portainer deployment, see the [upstream wiki guide](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/wiki/Deploy-Docker-container-in-Portainer).

## Session cookies

Login state is stored in `cookies/<username>.json`. Legacy pickle files (`cookies/<username>.pkl`) are loaded automatically and migrated to JSON on the next save.

```
.
├── run.py
└── cookies/
    └── your-twitch-username.json
```

If you see `ERR_BADAUTH` in the logs, delete the cookie file for that account and log in again.

**Do not commit cookie files.** They grant full access to your Twitch account.

## Platform notes

### Windows

Emoji in logs can cause encoding issues. Set `LoggerSettings(emoji=False)` if terminal output looks wrong. See [upstream Windows notes](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/55) for additional tips.

### Termux (Android)

```sh
pkg upgrade
pkg install python git rust libjpeg-turbo libcrypt ndk-sysroot clang zlib binutils tur-repo python-cryptography python-pandas
git clone https://github.com/combwizard/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2.git
cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2
cp example.py run.py && nano run.py
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

If `cryptography` fails to build:

```sh
export RUSTFLAGS=" -C lto=no"
export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET="$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's|host: ||p')"
pip install cryptography
```
