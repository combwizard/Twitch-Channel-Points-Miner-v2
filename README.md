# Twitch Channel Points Miner v2

A Python bot that watches Twitch streams on your behalf and earns [channel points](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide): watch time, bonuses, raids, predictions, drops, and more.

Fork of [rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2) (continuing [Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2)).

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.12+, a Twitch account.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/combwizard/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2.git
cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml   # edit username and streamers
python -m TwitchChannelPointsMiner
```

On first run you will be prompted to log in unless `cookies/<username>.json` already exists.

Minimal `config.yaml`:

```yaml
username: your-twitch-username
streamers:
  - streamer1
  - streamer2
```

Custom config path:

```sh
CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml python -m TwitchChannelPointsMiner
```

### What it does

The miner connects over GraphQL, Hermes WebSockets (default), and IRC. It watches up to **two live channels at a time** (a Twitch limit) and runs configured actions (claims, raids, predictions, drops).

Hermes replaced legacy PubSub in 2025. **`use_hermes: true` is the default** in `config.yaml`.

For bet strategies, notifications, and per-streamer Python objects, see [`example.py`](example.py).

## Web UI

Optional browser dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` when analytics is enabled:

```yaml
analytics:
  enabled: true
  host: 127.0.0.1   # use 0.0.0.0 in Docker
  port: 5000
  refresh_seconds: 5
  days_ago: 7
```

`analytics.enabled: true` also turns on point history collection. The UI shows live streamer status, session gains, charts, logs, and lets you add/remove streamers, claim drops, and stop the miner.

**Build the frontend** (only needed for local dev outside Docker):

```sh
cd web && npm install && npm run build
```

For frontend hot reload during development: `cd web && npm run dev` (proxies `/api` to port 5000).

There is no authentication on the Web UI. Bind to `127.0.0.1` or protect port 5000 at the network layer.

## Configuration

| What you need | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| Everyday settings (username, streamers, priorities, logger) | [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) |
| Full option reference (tables) | [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) |
| Predictions, notifications, Python API | [`example.py`](example.py) |

**Priority** controls which streamers get watched when several are live. Common values: `streak`, `drops`, `order`. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#priority-values) for the full list.

**Follower mode:** set `mine.followers: true` to load your follow list instead of `streamers`. Use `mine.blacklist` to skip channels.

## Docker

```sh
docker build -t combwizard/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2 .
```

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  miner:
    image: combwizard/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - CONFIG_PATH=/config/config.yaml
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/config/config.yaml
      - ./cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies
      - ./logs:/usr/src/app/logs
      - ./analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

Use `-it` on first run when no cookie file exists. Mount `config.yaml` **writable** if you use the Web UI to add or remove streamers.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `ERR_BADAUTH` in logs | Delete `cookies/<username>.json` and log in again |
| Garbled terminal emoji (Windows) | Set `logger.emoji: false` in `config.yaml` |
| Web UI add streamer fails | Ensure `config.yaml` mount is writable (not `:ro`) |
| Cookie security | Never commit `cookies/`; files grant full account access |

Login state is stored in `cookies/<username>.json`. Legacy `.pkl` files are migrated to JSON automatically.

### Termux (Android)

```sh
pkg install python git rust libjpeg-turbo libcrypt ndk-sysroot clang zlib binutils tur-repo python-cryptography python-pandas
git clone https://github.com/combwizard/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2.git
cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml && nano config.yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m TwitchChannelPointsMiner
```

If `cryptography` fails to build, see the [upstream Termux notes](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2#termux-android) or set `RUSTFLAGS=" -C lto=no"` before installing.
